The spread of fake news has become a significant challenge in today’s digital world. 
With the massive volume of news articles published daily, it’s becoming harder to distinguish between credible and misleading information. 
This creates a need for systems that can automatically classify news articles as true or fake, helping to reduce misinformation and protect public trust.

In this repo, will be developing a Semantic Classification model that uses the Word2Vec method to detect recurring patterns and themes in news articles. 
Using supervised learning models, the goal is to build a system that classifies news articles as either fake or true.
